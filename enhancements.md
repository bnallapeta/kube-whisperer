## Notes
- Priority levels:
  - P0: Must have for basic release
  - P1: Important for production use
  - P2: Valuable enhancements
  - P3: Nice to have
  - Future: Long-term considerations

- Implementation approach:
  1. Focus on completing P0 items first
  2. Implement P1 items based on user feedback
  3. Consider P2 and P3 items based on actual usage patterns
  4. Keep future considerations in mind during architecture decisions

- Regular review and reprioritization based on:
  - User feedback
  - Production metrics
  - Resource availability
  - Technology changes
